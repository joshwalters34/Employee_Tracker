# Employee_Tracker
This applicatiion is designed to keep track of employees at your company.  There are 3 data tables to store employee names, title, salary, manager, and department.  

## Motivation
My motivation for this application was to create an easy way to store, view and update employee information.  Running a company is very difficult and having an easy way to view employee and department information can be a real time saver. I feel this application can be very useful for employers and save them lots of time and energy.
